I will write code with documentation with appropriate comment so later it can be maintainable, readable, and adaptable. In project one I have used proper documentation called readme. Where I have used comment screenshot and code with explain. That documentation help to add more functionality in project tow like button where I just add more function. In future I will user crud for different client server or full-stack development.
Database systems concepts are applied and principles in the development application of a client/server. Client looking for search-and- rescue training, dogs that are good candidates are to be identified the scientist as a part of its work. Often in life-threating conditions, dogs are able to find and help to rescue humans or other animals. Client is seeking a software application that can work with categorize available dogs and existing data from the animal shelters to identify. For this project we need to create an app which will identify through CRUD module and will display information to end user. We will complete the development of this project by coding the database interface logic and the dashboard. In this the dashboard attributes are to be included. Dashboard must be a friendly-user, training time, intuitive interface that will reduce user errors. Therefore, the scientist requested on dashboard requirements, work on the project to help company are explained.
